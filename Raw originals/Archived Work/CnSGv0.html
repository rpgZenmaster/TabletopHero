 <br />
Following is a list of the things I'd like to talk about in the Castles and Starships Guide. I'd like the game to be able to handle a wide variety of settings. This guide should provide basics for various things that can be included in a homebrew setting, or transplanted into an existing setting. (This is as opposed to settings Splat books, which will list their own unique structures and vehicles.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Separate Manual:</strong> This manual should work in any of the following combinations-<br />
<ul><li>Players + C&amp;S (+ optional GMs, warguide)</li><li>WarGuide + C&amp;S (+ optional GMs)</li></ul><br />
Therefore, this guide can work with the WarGuide/Monsters <em>alone</em>, so that players can do big battles with structures and vehicles to spice it up.<br />
