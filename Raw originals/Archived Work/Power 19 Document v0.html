<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">1.) What is your game about?<strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The core system is not a game in itself. It is a tool designed to be used by the GM (and players) to become a game. Whatever game they choose it to be must be an “adventure” game, as the tool is not equipped to become, say, a game tackling deep moral questions nor an involved romance simulator.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">2.) What do the characters do?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The characters explore whatever fictional universe they find themselves in, and must choose a purpose for themselves. This exploration is within the physical realm (e.g. by literally exploring) as well as the social realm. In addition, the characters grow a lot of depth as a result of this exploration and thereby explore even themselves.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?**</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The players control the direction of growth of their characters to an extent, based on their own wishes. They also have a limited capacity to introduce new content into the game. The GM has an unlimited capacity to introduce new content, but a restricted ability to change existing content. The GM is also responsible for monitoring the players’ progress through the Bartle Ladder and matching it to player immersion, through the Hero’s Journey.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The setting is defined by the players and GM. The tool is designed to scale in literal, physical size and so adapts to any setting, as well as multiple interacting settings.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">Character Creation is designed to generate minimalist characters that start off very bland. The tool is designed such that the characters grow “true depth”, or in other words, the characters grow in a way that is meaningful to all the players in the game (rather than just a single controlling player).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The tool does not actually punish any sort of behavior itself; the GM and players are encouraged to deal with genuinely disruptive play outside of the game. The tool does allow for the introduction of “damaged content”, however, which is not the same as punishment. The tool doesn’t truly reward any particular behaviors either, instead simply allowing character growth in a direction desired by the player.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The tool works on an economics system. Behaviors or content-introduction (positive or negative) that introduce interesting elements to the game are rewarded through debiting the player’s meta-currency. Behaviors or content-introduction that are boring are not rewarded and credit the player’s meta-currency.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">Much of the responsibility is handed to the GM for narration of anything not related to the PCs, and the players entirely narrate their PC’s actions. However, the players also have some ability to handle content outside their characters.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The tool is designed to allow the GM to hook their interest with the Hero’s Journey, and keeps their interest by following that journey and keeping it in pace with Bartle’s Ladder. The game also subtly pushes the players’ to a crescendo. (The kind of crescendo depends entirely upon the players’ choices)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">There are two telescoping modes of resolution: social and physical. They can run concurrently, as the social resolution works with counters, dice, and in-character conversation while the physical resolution works with dice and the combat wheel. Both kinds of resolution mechanics can stack, and both are character currency generators, creating a profit. Social mechanics are like a “service”, and physical mechanics are like a “product”.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">Both the physical and social mechanics only generate a currency profit by being relevant and interesting, creating character and exploration growth potential.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">Yes; they advance by spending their currency profit on permanent changes of their characters or their environment.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">All growth and environmental changes allow for greater exploration opportunities.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The players should feel excitement for reaching the game crescendo, for each Hero’s Journey/Bartle’s Ladder cycle. The link between the creation of currency profit and the reaching of this crescendo should be made clear by the tool.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The mechanics allowing the GM to stitch together the Hero’s Journey and Bartle’s Ladder receives extra attention, because it is critical to keep these two in synch in order for the players to enjoy the experience. No color will be added by the tool itself, but the GM should be given extra tools to generate colorful content quickly.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in? Why?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">The design of the tool to focus on the union of the Hero’s Journey with Bartle’s Ladder, because I think this will prove to launch the game into the stratosphere, in terms of how entertaining it is to play.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">17.) Where does your game take the players that other games can’t, don’t, or won’t?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">Everywhere, in terms of setting and color. The Social system, along with a Physical system that stacks, scales, and telescopes, should allow the players to explore any setting they can think of, or even combine vastly different settings.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">Publish to the internet, and sell the Combat Wheel.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">19.) Who is your target audience?</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 10pt;">Monkey’s Island, Mario and Banjo-Kazooie type game players, as well as anyone who’s played an RPG because they wanted that particular itch scratched but were unsatisfied with what they got from other RPGs.</span>
