 Professions have a base number of Chits spent on them. This chit value is then multiplied by the scores of the character’s techniques, to form a one-layer matrix. Whenever the player needs to perform a skill check, the player uses the base value that was previously calculated from “Profession Base” * “Technique Mod”, where the latter value is the relevant Technique Modifier, which is based on the level of the Technique.<br />

This modifier is multiplied by the base “Profession” score of the most relevant Profession whenever a skill check needs to be made. The modifier is x1 at the level of Unconscious competence, because these are the characters’ most favoured skills, and the modifier does not grow at supercompetence levels (i.e. only the skill-stacking ability grows.) All techniques have an associated learning curve as well. For simple things such as rock-skipping, the learning curve is shallow. For complex things, the learning curve is extremely high. The GM should make a judgement call in most cases. For characters whose attributes aren’t high enough, they are unable to achieve greatness in Techniques for the related attribute.<br />
