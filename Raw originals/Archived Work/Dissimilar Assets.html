 <br />
ANOTHER IDEA in this manner: besides weapons that deal “piercing”, “slashing”, or “blunt”, and armors that resist in different measures, HOW ABOUT<br />
Have it in the rules that you can vary your attack to have jiggle the damage-type around a little bit. (I got this idea from Order of the Stick #216)<br />
<br />
<br />
Varied attacks to try and better your effectiveness against the opponent, even in the face of resistance. This would incur a penalty and would be roleplayed as the character trying really hard to MAKE his weapon hit appropriately. EG skeletons are immune to, say, piercing, and so a rapier would do no damage normally. However, by using a rapier in a normally far less efficient way, he can hit the skeleton for non-piercing damage. Similarly, a rock monster immune to blunt damage may be hit by a dwarven hammer if the wielder aims for fissures.<br />
<br />
The GM should be able to veto this ability if inappropriate.<br />
