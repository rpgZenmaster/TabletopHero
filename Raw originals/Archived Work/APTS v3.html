 What is the purpose of skills?<br />
- To allow the characters to perform physical actions<br />
What do I want from the skills?<br />
- Intuitive and easy-to-use from a player point of view<br />
- Quick to generate for ANY character level<br />
- Stackable<br />
How about we STOP TRYING for SYMMETRY and make each supposed “attribute” just it’s own thing.<br />
- Mass: similar to physical size; does not affect your chances of success directly; it goes into physical derived attributes<br />
- Strength: does not affect “chances of success” attributes; just affects how much you make things hurt, if you succeed; affected by Mass<br />
- Agility: a “chances of success” attribute, for body movements; affected by Mass<br />
- Stamina: physical health and resistance; affected by Mass<br />
Specialization: direct + to AGILITY ONLY for the purposes of a single skill; may feed back into agility?<br />
Practical Knowledge Skills: stuff that doesn’t really increase in effectiveness with increased ability scores, such as lock picking<br />
Theoretical Knowledge (or whatever the opposite is): stuff that the character simply knows and may provide a bonus to practical situations (social or physical)
