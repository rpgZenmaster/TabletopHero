Please note that many of the Glossary.html entries are ripped from or at least inspired by the entries from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow">&quot;The Provisional Glossary.html&quot;</a> by Ron Edwards, at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">The Forge</a>. Entries that are direct quotes of the entries given on The Forge are <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">indicated by a Courier New font-face</span>. In some cases, definitions include lingo that isn't defined in this Glossary.html. I decided not to keep such lingo since it starts to lead outside of what I'm interested in for our game. Furthermore, Mr. Edward's Glossary was written from a perspective recognizing only three Creative Agendas, while Mr. Bartle's models recognize up to eight player types. These classification systems are not necessarily incompatible, but come at the subject angle from different angles. See <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Theory Development.html">&quot;Theory Development&quot;</a> and <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Current Work.html">&quot;Current Work&quot;</a> for more information.<br />

<br />
<a name="achiever"></a><u>achiever</u> - One of the four player types that results when the implicit/explicit axis of Richard Bartle's 3D Player Types model is collapsed. (See the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a> by Richard Bartle.) Achievers are in the World/Active quadrant, and therefore feel most rewarded when their accomplishments are validated within the structure and rules of the game universe itself. In other words, they prefer to win games in the most traditional sense of the word &quot;win&quot;. Compare to <u>explorer</u>, <u>killer</u>, and <u>socializer</u>.<br />

<u><a name="big model"></a>Big Model, the</u> - Built by Ron Edwards, the Big Model suggests that the layers of a particular instance of a role playing game are rather like an onion, with each layer being encapsulated within another. The four recognized layers are: <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#social%20contract">Social Contract</a> (outermost), <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#exploration">Exploration</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#technique">Techniques</a>, and <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#ephemera">Ephemera </a>(innermost). The model also recognizes three modes of play, called <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#creative%20agenda">Creative Agendas</a>, which are: <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#gamism">Gamism</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#narrativism">Narrativism</a>, <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#simulationism">Simulationism</a>. The four layers are treated as the medium, while the Creative Agenda is the ultimate point of playing, that the players want to express using that medium. I believe the example given on <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">The Forge</a> is of a painter, though I can no longer find it. The choice of what the subject should be for the painting is the painter's Creative Agenda. The colours and brushes and canvas he chooses are his medium. Some choices of medium are better than others for expressing any given subject.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><a name="ephemera"></a>ephemera</u> - The moment-to-moment events that take place during a roleplaying game; e.g. the dice rolled, tables checked, and sentences spoken. Any given <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#technique">technique</a> consists of a string of one or more ephemera.<br />

It is collectively created and shared among the players and <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#game%20master">game master</a>. It comprises the meat of what people typically mean when they talk about traditional role-playing. There is emphasis on the fact that the shared imagined space is created collectively, with input from all players. Without this layer, the activity might more aptly be called story-telling or fiction-building.<br />

<a name="explorer"></a><u>explorer</u> - Distinct from <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#exploration">&quot;exploration&quot;</a>, the explorer is one of the four player types that results when the implicit/explicit axis of Richard Bartle's 3D Player Types model is collapsed. (See the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a> by Richard Bartle.) Explorers are in the World/Interactive quadrant, and therefore feel most rewarded when learning about and mastering the game universe, in the sense of becoming &quot;good at&quot; the game, even though the actual played character may not be powerful. Compare to <u>achiever</u>, <u>killer</u>, and <u>socializer</u>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><a name="friend"></a>friend</u> - As a player type, friends' avatars exist in the virtual or imagined world, but players who fall into this category focus more on interacting with the other players behind the avatars.

<a name="fruitful void"></a>Fruitful Void, the - A term originally coined by Vincent Baker of <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lumpley.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lumpley.com</a>, the Fruitful Void is the collection of <em>emergent</em> attributes of a tabletop RPG. The Fruitful Void defines what a given tabletop game is &quot;about&quot; in the most meaningful sense. In a similar way, Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is involves two particular lovers and their quarrelling families but is <em>about</em> the turmoil felt by the lovers having to choose between each other and their senses of duty to their respective families. In a tabletop RPG, this Fruitful Void may not correlate with the game designers' <em>intended experience</em> depending on how well they build the game. For example, a game designer may base a game upon Romeo and Juliet with the intention of evoking the same emotional turmoil in the players (i.e. a <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#narrativism">Narrativist</a> <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#creative agenda">CA</a>), but if the Romeo character scores &quot;experience points&quot; for killing Capulets, it may result in a purely <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#gamism">Gamist</a> game.<br />

<u><a name="griefer"></a>griefer</u> - Griefers act on other players with no sharp, specific goals in mind beyond the intention usually to hurt or help. This is the beginning state of players who are new to the game but prefer to focus on the other participants in the game rather than the virtual or imagined world.

Killers are in the Player/Active quadrant, and therefore feel most rewarded by acting upon and eliciting a response from other players. Although the connotation of &quot;killer&quot; is negative, this player type includes those that enjoy teaching and aiding other players, for no other reason than the good feeling they get from doing so. It can also include, say, politicians, who enjoy exerting power over other people though not necessarily in a violent way. Compare to <u>achiever</u>, <u>explorer</u>, and <u>socializer</u>.<br />

On the 3D Player Types model presented in Richard Bartle's article <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a>, planners are in the Explicit, World, Acting octant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="player character"></a><u>player character</u> or <u>PC</u> - A character in an RPG controlled by a player who is not the game master.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><a name="politician"></a>politician</u> - Players who enjoy exerting the influence they have gained in the virtual or imagined environment on other players. On the 3D Player Types model presented in Richard Bartle's article <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a>, politicians are in the Explicit, Players, Acting octant. Though I haven't tested this claim, I expect this includes <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#non-player%20character">non-player characters</a> in shared imagined worlds due to the fact that all <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#non-player%20character">NPCs </a>in this scenario are still ultimately controlled by a human being, namely the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#game%20master">GM</a>. This is not true in virtual worlds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="premise"></a><u>premise</u> - <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">(adapted from <a name="ref3source"></a><a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#ref3">Egri</a>[3]) A generalizable, problematic aspect of human interactions. Early in the process of creating or experiencing a story, a Premise is best understood as a proposition or perhaps an ideological challenge to the world represented by the protagonist's passions. Later in the process, resolving the conflicts of the story transforms Premise into a theme - a judgmental statement about how to act, behave, or believe. In role-playing, &quot;protagonist&quot; typically indicates a character mainly controlled by one person.

<br />
<br />
<a name="reward"></a><u>reward</u> - The word reward in its usual context refers strictly to the benefits and awards given to the PCs upon achieving some victory. Less often, it refers to the personal and social gratification experienced by a player due to events unfolding in the RPG. A given reward need not also be a reward for the character, nor need it even be within the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#shared%20imagined%20space">SIS</a>. An example of this could be the hideous painful death of a player's character, which the player finds entertaining for reasons of drama. Also see <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#reward%20cycle">reward cycle</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="reward cycle"></a><u>reward cycle</u> - The reward cycle is the explicit or emergent cycle through which the PCs go to achieve &quot;rewards&quot;, in the sense of the personal and social gratification as experienced by the player. A single game need not have just one reward cycle. An emergent reward cycle may circumvent a game designer's intended reward cycle if the game is designed <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#incoherence">incoherently</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="roleplaying game"></a><u>roleplaying game</u> - The definition of what constitutes a roleplaying game is difficult to narrow down, but in essence it is a game consisting of the exploration of a <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#shared%20imagined%20space">SIS</a>. Two good resources are the article <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm" rel="nofollow">&quot;Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit MUDs&quot;</a> by Mr. Richard Bartle and the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#big%20model">Big Model</a>, built with tremendous input from Ron Edwards. The former was written specifically about <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#mud">MUDs</a>, but the same arguments may apply to roleplaying games to some degree.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="rules"></a><u>rules</u> - Rules refers to the set of instructions given for any particular game or RPG. Such instructions may exclude subsets of the instructions given by the game designer(s) and/or include extra instructions created by a particular set of players. The aforementioned extra instructions are oftentimes called &quot;house rules&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><a name="scientist"></a>scientist</u> - A type of player who, as the category name suggests, enjoys testing the rules and boundaries of a world (virtual, imagined, or otherwise). On the 3D Player Types model presented in Richard Bartle's article <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a>, scientists are in the Explicit, World, Interacting octant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><a name="screentime"></a>screentime</u> - Screentime is the time spent by a PC in the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#spotlight">spotlight</a>. In essence, it is the amount of time that all other players take a step back and allow a PC to perform actions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="search time"></a><u>search time</u> - <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">The real time required to determine necessary values or information prior to applying a resolution <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#technique">Technique</a>.

<br />
<u><a name="seeker"></a>seeker</u> - From <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#bartle%20path">the Bartle Path</a>, a seeker is a type of player who is ignorant of the methods of play, and isn't even aware of what those methods are. Typically, such a player is either new to the game or hasn't yet learned how to play using a specific subset of the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#rules">rules</a>. A seeker displays &quot;unconscious incompetence&quot; as discussed in <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessballs.com/consciouscompetencelearningmodel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessballs.com/consciouscompetencelearningmodel.htm</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="shared imagined space"></a><u>shared imagined space</u> or <u>SIS</u> - The imaginary environment collectively built by the players and the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#game%20master">game master</a> through usage of <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#system">System</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="simulationism"></a><u>simulationist</u>, <u>simulationism</u> - Simulationism is one of the three major modes of play (i.e. <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#creative%20agenda">Creative Agendas</a>) recognized in the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#big%20model">Big Model</a>. The primary focus of this mode is to achieve immersion within the fantasy itself as a priority over other goals, such as interpersonal agendas between the players. See <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/15/" rel="nofollow">&quot;Simulationism: The Right to Dream&quot;</a> by Ron Edwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="epic simulationism"></a><u>simulationism, epic</u> - Epic Simulationism is a subset of <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#simulationism">Simulationism</a> where <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#exploration">exploration</a> is simply a means to an end, that end being the player's exploration of his or her own identity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><a name="spotlight"></a>spotlight</u> - The proverbial spotlight is a reference to the attention given to a player by the other players of a tabletop RPG, while that player's character is active. This term is virtually never used in reference to the game master, because the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#game%20master">game master</a> typically doesn't have a PC and therefore is never truly &quot;onscreen&quot; (see <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#screentime">screentime</a>).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="social contract"></a><u>social contract</u> - <span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">All interactions and relationships among the role-playing group, including emotional connections, logistic arrangements, and expectations. All role-playing is a subset of the Social Contract.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="socializer"></a><u>socializer</u> - One of the four player types that results when the implicit/explicit axis of Richard Bartle's 3D Player Types model is collapsed. (See the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a> by Richard Bartle.) Socializers are in the Social/Interactive quadrant, and therefore feel most rewarded by interacting with other human beings on an emotional level, even if engaging in nothing more than simple conversation. Compare to <u>achiever</u>, <u>explorer</u>, and <u>killer</u>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="stance"></a><u>stance</u> - The positioning of the player's perspective and mode of control, relative to that player's character.<br />
<ul><li><u>Actor:</u><span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;"> The person playing a character determines the character's decisions and actions using only knowledge and perceptions that the character would have. This stance does not necessarily include identifying with the character and feeling what he or she &quot;feels,&quot; nor does it require in-character dialogue.</span></li><li><u>Author:</u><span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;"> The person playing a character determines the character's decisions and actions based on the person's priorities, independently of the character's knowledge and perceptions. Author Stance may or may not include a retroactive &quot;motivation&quot; of the character to perform the actions. When it lacks this feature, it is called Pawn Stance.</span></li><li><u>Director:</u><span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;"> The person playing a character determines aspects of the environment relative to the character in some fashion, entirely separately from the character's knowledge or ability to influence events. Therefore the player has not only determined the character's actions, but the context, timing, and spatial circumstances of those actions, or even features of the world separate from the characters. Director Stance is often confused with narration of an in-game event, but the two concepts are not necessarily related.</span></li><li><u>Pawn:</u><span style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;"> A subset of Author Stance which lacks the retroactive &quot;motivation&quot; of the character to perform the actions. Often but wrongly identified with <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#gamism">Gamist</a> play.</span></li></ul><br />
<br />
<br />
<a name="statistic"></a><u>statistic</u> - From <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)</a>, &quot;A <strong>statistic</strong> (or <strong>stat</strong>) in <span style="color: #0645ad; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game" rel="nofollow">role-playing games</a></span> is a piece of <span style="color: #0645ad; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data" rel="nofollow">data</a></span> which represents a particular <span style="color: #0645ad; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy)" rel="nofollow">aspect</a></span> of a <span style="color: #0645ad; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character" rel="nofollow">fictional character</a></span>.
