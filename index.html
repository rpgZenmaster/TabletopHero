    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Clearly, people are most biased in regards to their own works and inventions. However, I believe I can objectively call the Normal Device, invented by Bryan, Daniel, and Simon, the most innovative new tabletop RPG device to come along since the invention of dice itself. Such a device, as powerful and efficient as it may be, is futile if it is placed into a crappy game. It is unlikely that we'll be able to create an amazing game around the normal device purely by chance (especially since the lightning bolt of inspiration doesn't strike the same place twice!) So, the question then becomes: what makes for an awesome game? The knee-jerk answer is to say that an awesome game is one that is really, really fun. However, this doesn't answer the question, it just pushes it back a level. What makes for a &quot;fun game&quot;? Answering this question is where the real work comes in.
