<ul><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">End objective needs to be clear.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Sub-goals need to be obvious.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Build puzzles forward: </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Present the problem before you present the solution. You should not expect players to remember something they weren’t looking for in the first place.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Puzzles should be like boxes, not cages:</span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"> If the players are required to solve a puzzle before they can explore the world, they are likely to get bored and frustrated a lot more quickly. Have several puzzles available at a given time, so that if they get stuck on one, they can move on to another, or do something else entirely.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Puzzles must advance the story: </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">If a puzzle has no connection to the story, it is an obstruction rather than a development (though side-plots are okay).</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Solutions must not be arbitrary:</span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Though the solution to a puzzle need not be obvious, it must make sense. If a puzzle can only be solved by trial-and-error or dumb luck, it’s a bad puzzle.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Events must not be unconnected: </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">If certain events must happen before the story will continue, you must make that clear to the players. For example, if the players need to pick up a magic ring before a mysterious door will open, connect the ring to the door. Otherwise, the players may discount the ring and quickly get frustrated looking for another solution.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Keep the solution available: </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">As long as a puzzle is unsolved, the players should always be able to get what they need to solve it.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Let them live and learn: </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The players must not be required to kill their characters in order to find the solution to a puzzle. Danger is inherent in drama, but danger should be survivable if the players are clever.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Reward Intent:</span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">If it’s clear that the players have the right idea, let it work. Don’t penalize them for coming up with a solution that is correct in spirit but which doesn’t work by the rules or set-up.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Grant incremental rewards: </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Smaller and more frequent awards provide motivation to continue. Sometimes, simply revealing more story elements, characters, or areas to explore can be enough.</span></li><li><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif;">Real time is bad drama: </span><span style="color: #111111; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Tailoring the clock to the players’ actions will heighten the excitement.</span></li></ul><br />

<h2 id="toc1"><a name="Gilbert’s Rules of Thumb:-Other Game-Design Goals:"></a><span style="text-align: justify;">Other Game-Design Goals:</span></h2>
 <ol><li>Balanced – must not destroy the campaign world, or ability to tell good stories.</li><li>Meaningful choice – should involve some kind of strategy and depth, not just “roll a single dice and that’s the outcome”.</li><li>Player and Character Ability – The system should take into account both player choice as well as character ability. This applies to NPCs as well.</li><li>Inclusive – should involve all players, not just those whose characters are good in social situations.</li><li>Realistic – Social ability shouldn’t be mind control. It should take into account the personality of the character.</li><li>Concurrency – The roleplaying and system mechanics should work together, not supercede each other.</li><li>Fun – The social system must be fun.</li></ol>
