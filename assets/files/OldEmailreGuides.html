Hi gents,<br />
<br />
I've started compiling a list of things I want to include in the three separate manuals for our game, the PHB, DM's Guide, and Monstrous Manual. The intention of these lists is to keep track of the NON-obvious stuff I'd like to include. Character creation in the PHB is obvious, but something I want in the PHB that isn't obvious is different ways to play - e.g. kick-in-the-door vs exploration, in-character vs out-of-character.<br />
<br />
In writing up lists for the three manuals, a pattern has emerged:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>the Player's Guide is concerned with ONLY the very personal level. Combat involves at least one character with a &quot;soul&quot;, i.e. fully developed character sheet with all the stats and abilities, possibly a description and history too.</li><li>the Monster's Guide is concerned with ONLY the non personal level, i.e. quickly generating single or multiple creatures with a certain degree of facelessness. Taken up a scale, worrying about skirmishes or wars between armies, or techniques for developing a mob (even if that mob's role is only social). Due to the facelessness, the DM can avoid doing up the irrelevant details unless/until those details become relevant.</li><li>the DM's Guide discusses how to knit the two together. It talks about the depth an NPC can have: meat (pure combat), face (pure social), supporting character (meat + face), or main character (just like a PC but controlled by DM), and about how a given NPC can gain depth as time goes on. It talks about running small, personal scale conflicts with larger scale conflicts concurrently.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<br />
As a consequence of this pattern, it has occurred to me that we could write the &quot;Monster's Manual&quot; so that it is independent of the Player's Guide. Traditional D&amp;D tries to do personal-character PC gaming in the Player's Guide, tacks on war-gaming in the DM's Guide, and the Monster's Manual is just a dictionary .. a big look-up table. It relegates the Monster's Guide to an add-on, something you don't need to play the game but which makes it easier. Furthermore, the book is useless without the PHB and DM's Guide. I don't believe it has to be this way.<br />
<br />
If we recategorize the Monster's Guide as a WarGamer's handbook that supports a variety of settings, we find a new audience for this book and allow existing audiences a more diverse set of playing experiences. Now, to play our game in the traditional D&amp;D style, you still need the two books and third is still optional-but-highly-recommended, but you can also play the game using only the Third Guide (old monster's/new wargamers). In fact, players could outright build characters using the MG/WG, but the players won't have access to the templates and skill-options, etc., available in the PHB, nor will the description of how to build a single, standalone character be as fully developed.<br />
<br />
One drawback is that some material will be repeated in both the PHB and MG/WG, but as I suggest in the last paragraph, we can get away with minimizing the overlap, so I don't think this is a problem. (Got the MG/WG, but want your character to have more soul? Buy our PHB too :D )<br />
