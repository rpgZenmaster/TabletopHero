What I've been working on for the last few weeks might not be exactly what you have in mind, but I'm trying to build a system that supports social play, revolving around negotiations and parties and such, that attempts to balance the participation of both the social skilled an the unskilled, without turning it into an overtly mechanical social-combat type exchange. The general idea is to build a lot of stuff *around* social encounters that gives people more to do in them, like how Old School D&amp;D gives you spells, equipment, and an XP system that helps and rewards you for exploring, but doesn't do it for you.<br />
<br />
Though it probably helps that I'm building it primarily for a text environment. It's much easier for less-than-social-skilled folks like myself to get involved in a game like that with more time to think.
