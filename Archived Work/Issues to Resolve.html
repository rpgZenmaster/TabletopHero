-- Social Contract control:<br />
- the game outside the game; manipulating the game, inter-player conflicts, negotiations, channelling dominating players.<br />
- the approach to the game; is it gonna be immersive/ultra-serious? immersive/casual? unimmersive/hack'n'slash?<br />
<br />
-- Camera Lenses: &quot;action over substance&quot; versus &quot;substance over action&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Very distinct Rules for Authority Camera Control: managing authority, what gets established in the SIS, reversing time if necessary<br />
- Think of a boardgame like Monopoly: Very distinct turns. Very obvious delineation between the state of PLAY and NOT PLAY. This is not true of most roleplaying. It gets extremely muddy deciding who's doing what, when, and how. Are you speaking in character or not? Discussing a course of action or choosing a course of action?<br />
- example: I want to be sneaky against another player. Difficult because the player might contest. i.e. &quot;Well no wait, you can't do that because I was on the left side, not the right.&quot;<br />
<br />
-- How can we operate in an RPG? What I'm thinking is to start treating it like a sport: the ref blows the whistle and everybody gets in game mode. There's some external chatter but very little because players who don't pay attention will lose advantage. They can call time-outs when they need a break though. There can also be offsides, to dispute stuff that has been introduced into the SIS.<br />

-- Large Scale Structure of the Game<br />
1) Campaign Entry/Exit<br />
a) Content Focus: Ratio of &quot;just play&quot; to let's talk about it?<br />
a) Difficulty Dial: How dangerous should the game be for your characters? How does the difficulty level affect a character's survivability?<br />
2) Session Entry/Exit &amp; Timeouts<br />
3) Adventure Entry/Exit<br />
4) Adventure Phases<br />
5) Adventure Phase Progress<br />
<br />

The traditional way: &quot;Make up difficult or interesting situations and throw them at the players, who have made difficult and interesting characters who then respond to the shit that's being thrown at them. There's a sense of continuity, the events in the games could be related like a story, I use dramatic techniques to keep the experience interesting, but I am NOT IN ANY WAY TRYING TO MAKE A GOOD STORY, or address themes or otherwise attempting to create a product that can be examined or appreciate outside of the experience of play.&quot;<br />
<br />
My form of Illusionism: &quot;Use the traditional way, but then weave strands together to make the appearance of a linear plot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were playing D&amp;D and I have an adventure path where I expect the party to travel down the main road where they'll encounter a blockade. I want them to encounter the blockade so they discover the existence of the evil warlord. The adventurers instead decide to go through the woods. I, as the DM, still want them to learn about the warlord, and I want them to discover the blockade, so, viola, there are a band of wild elfs traveling through the woods that are heading the the blockade to tear it down. Is this illusionism? Are the encounters in the woods meaningless? Is discovering a blockade on a road the same thing as discovering a band of wild elf rebels in the woods who want to destroy it? I don't think so. The GM gets what he wants, the players actions meaningfully effect the content of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Contracycle, you mentioned being willing to concede control of the &quot;story&quot; if you're primarily there for exploration instead, but -- even in the cases you're supposedly there for exploration, is exploration really what you're looking for?<br />
I mentioned the N64's Banjo-Kazooie as my own personal example. Let's examine each of the facets of exploration in detail and see if they're extraordinary:<br />
<ul><li>Character - Bland characters. Face it. Banjo and Kazooie had somewhat interesting moves, but were otherwise boring (and even a tad obnoxious)</li><li>Setting - Also bland. I (sincerely) kinda hoped to see Jinjos wandering around their village living their day-to-day Jinjo lives. No such luck. Blah.</li><li>Situation - A witch steals a young girl's youth to enhance her beauty? Please! Done to death!</li><li>System - The moves were decent. Something out of a Mario game. Nothing outrageously innovative though.</li><li>Color - Okay, here I'll admit the colour was interesting, the mixing of theme lands. This helped. However, by itself, the colour couldn't have supported the game.</li></ul>So, where does B-K get its magic? It combines the elements in a relatively unique combination to allow the player to learn the moves and grow with the characters, feeling the same sense of achievement that the characters themselves might feel if they weren't fictional. The emotions you feel when Grunty finally gets knocked off the tower .. it's like a tonic!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its funny and perhaps irrelevant but when trying to think of examples from my own RP-ing I keep having this instance come up from D&amp;D where are PC's spent all this time sailing, so I decided to put all my skill points while leveling into ship related shit... for some reason that was a really rewarding experience for me, just because I had these points on my sheet that I could look at and go &quot;oooh, thats all the stuff I learned while we were sailing.&quot; Contra's example of the vampire Prince reminded me of this too, because it seemed like what he did there was all about reinforcing the SIS. For him, figuring that little bit about vamp politics reinforced the SIS, for me looking at my char sheet and having that in character reminisce (which was very much just me internally thinking out how my character might feel) also reinforced the SIS, I got to put my imagination into action, as did Contra...&quot;<br />
