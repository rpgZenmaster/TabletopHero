 <span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px;">The ultimate <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=Normal Project/Glossary.html#reward cycle">reward cycle</a> we ought to be aiming for is encapsulated in the follow diagram, which I've called the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=Normal Project/Glossary.html#bartle path">&quot;Bartle Path&quot;</a>. The graph results by collapsing the World/Player axis of Richard Bartle's 3D Player Types model. (See the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a> by Richard Bartle.)</span><br />

Note that the green arrows come into existence when you look at the Development Tracks, shown below:<br />

Regardless of what path the player develops along, ultimately they follow the progression:<br />
<ol><li>Instinctives - Implicit Acting (Griefer, Opportunist)</li><li>Doers - Explicit Acting (Networker, Scientist)</li><li>Builders - Explicit Interacting (Politician, Planner)</li><li>Masters - Implicit Interacting (Friend, Hacker)</li></ol><br />
One good idea that seems to be used only in the newer indie RPGs is having the RPG go through distinct phases. The diagrams above certainly lend themselves to a game chopped up into four-phase cycles. Each phase would map to a level of immersion as discussed by <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">Bartle</a>.<br />
