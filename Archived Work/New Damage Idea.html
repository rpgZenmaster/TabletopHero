We've being doing health and damage in terms of blocky blocks.<br />
<br />
While I principle I like this, it makes for ugly-assed scaling, and the size table makes it worse.<br />
<br />
HERE'S AN IDEA .. races have scalars representing their size. All you have to do is match scalars to make them compatible in a fight.<br />
<br />
This affects combat damage and attack bonus/penalties by multiplying and dividing.<br />
<br />
My weapon does 10 damage, but I'm size 10. You're size 100. So my weapon does 100/size 10 = 10 damage. Weapon damages and size calculations can be precalc'ed quickly before combat. For ease of use, if you're in a &quot;bigger&quot; or &quot;smaller&quot; world, you should scale your values to match. Similarly, if an alien comes to your world that is smaller or bigger relative to him, he should scale his values to match.<br />
