    <span class="glossary-borrowed">indicated by a special font-face</span>
    . In some cases, definitions include lingo that isn't defined in this
    Glossary.html. I decided not to keep such lingo since it starts to lead
    outside of what I'm interested in for our game. Furthermore, Mr. Edward's
    Glossary was written from a perspective recognizing only three Creative
    Agendas, while Mr. Bartle's models recognize up to eight player types. These
    classification systems are not necessarily incompatible, but come at the
    subject angle from different angles. See

        Built by Ron Edwards, the Big Model suggests that the layers of a
        particular instance of a role playing game are rather like an onion, with
        each layer being encapsulated within another. The four recognized layers
        are:

        , which are:

        the ultimate point of playing, that the players want to express using that
        medium. I believe the example given on
        <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/">
          The Forge
        </a>
        is of a painter, though I can no longer find it. The choice of what the
        subject should be for the painting is the painter's Creative Agenda. The
        colours and brushes and canvas he chooses are his medium. Some choices of
        medium are better than others for expressing any given subject.

          http://www.lumpley.com
        </a>
        , the Fruitful Void is the collection of emergent attributes of a
        tabletop RPG. The Fruitful Void defines what a given tabletop game is
        &quot;about&quot; in the most meaningful sense. In a similar way,
        Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is involves two particular
        lovers and their quarrelling families but is about the turmoil felt by
        the lovers having to choose between each other and their senses of duty
        to their respective families. In a tabletop RPG, this Fruitful Void may
        not correlate with the game designers' intended experience depending on
        how well they build the game. For example, a game designer may base a
        game upon Romeo and Juliet with the intention of evoking the same

<a name="killer"></a><u>killer</u> - One of the four player types that results when the implicit/explicit axis of Richard Bartle's 3D Player Types model is collapsed. (See the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a> by Richard Bartle.) Killers are in the Player/Active quadrant, and therefore feel most rewarded by acting upon and eliciting a response from other players. Although the connotation of &quot;killer&quot; is negative, this player type includes those that enjoy teaching and aiding other players, for no other reason than the good feeling they get from doing so. It can also include, say, politicians, who enjoy exerting power over other people though not necessarily in a violent way. Compare to <u>achiever</u>, <u>explorer</u>, and <u>socializer</u>.<br />

<a name="non-player character"></a><u>non-player character</u> or <u>NPC</u> - Virtually all non-player characters are background characters, though some play a significant role in the game.

Though I haven't tested this claim, I expect this includes <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#non-player%20character">non-player characters</a> in shared imagined worlds due to the fact that all <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#non-player%20character">NPCs </a>in this scenario are still ultimately controlled by a human being, namely the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#game%20master">GM</a>.

Early in the process of creating or experiencing a story, a Premise is best understood as a proposition or perhaps an ideological challenge to the world represented by the protagonist's passions. Later in the process, resolving the conflicts of the story transforms Premise into a theme - a judgmental statement about how to act, behave, or believe. In role-playing, &quot;protagonist&quot; typically indicates a character mainly controlled by one person.

<br />
<a name="reward"></a><u>reward</u> - The word reward in its usual context refers strictly to the benefits and awards given to the PCs upon achieving some victory. Less often, it refers to the personal and social gratification experienced by a player due to events unfolding in the RPG. A given reward need not also be a reward for the character, nor need it even be within the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#shared%20imagined%20space">SIS</a>. An example of this could be the hideous painful death of a player's character, which the player finds entertaining for reasons of drama.

<br />
<a name="reward cycle"></a><u>reward cycle</u> - The reward cycle is the explicit or emergent cycle through which the PCs go to achieve &quot;rewards&quot;, in the sense of the personal and social gratification as experienced by the player. A single game need not have just one reward cycle.

<a name="rules"></a><u>rules</u> - Rules refers to the set of instructions given for any particular game or RPG. Such instructions may exclude subsets of the instructions given by the game designer(s) and/or include extra instructions created by a particular set of players.

<u><a name="spotlight"></a>spotlight</u> - The proverbial spotlight is a reference to the attention given to a player by the other players of a tabletop RPG, while that player's character is active. This term is virtually never used in reference to the game master, because the <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#game%20master">game master</a> typically doesn't have a PC and therefore is never truly &quot;onscreen&quot; (see <a class="wiki_link" href="index.php?page=1&address=Normal%20Project/Glossary.html#screentime">screentime</a>).<br />

(See the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/VWWPP.pdf" rel="nofollow">&quot;Virtual Worlds: Why People Play&quot; Introduction</a> by Richard Bartle.) Socializers are in the Social/Interactive quadrant, and therefore feel most rewarded by interacting with other human beings on an emotional level, even if engaging in nothing more than simple conversation. Compare to <u>achiever</u>, <u>explorer</u>, and <u>killer</u>.<br />
