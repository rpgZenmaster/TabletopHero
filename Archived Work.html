  This page contains all the work we've done that is either out-of-date or has
  been discarded. There is a lot of independent work from Daniel that is the
  result of brainstorming.

    <h2>Tactical Combat &amp; Combat Advantage -</h2>
    The idea of Combat Advantage was that when combatants would fight, they
    would struggle to retain combat advantage as in a tug-of-war. Alone, it was
    not a measure of the ability of the characters and was instead intended to
    allow players to use the ideas of tactical combat (see
    <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/elements01nov02.html">
      &quot;Elements of Tactics&quot;
    </a>
    by Brian Gleichman). If neither combatant has advantage, the weapon damage
    scores stay at their default. Otherwise, they can be shifted around. I
    eventually abandoned the idea as being much too complicated for the benefits
    it offered to play, and much too prone to abuse.

    The idea of Combat Advantage was that when combatants would fight, they
    would struggle to retain this combat advantage as in a tug-of-war. Alone,
    it was not a measure of the ability of the characters and was instead a
    layer of tools the players used to provide advantages or disadvantages for
    in-character (but nonetheless real-life) conversations.
